In this repository, we will focus on other projects/research that the US-based non-profit MITRE Corporation has created for the cybersecurity community, specifically:

    ATT&CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
    CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
    ENGAGE (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
    D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
    AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

What is the ATT&CK® framework? According to the website, "MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base 
of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations." In 2013, MITRE began to address the need to
record and document common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups
used against enterprise Windows networks. This started with an internal project known as FMX (Fort Meade Experiment). 
Within this project, selected security professionals were tasked to emulated adversarial TTPs against a network, 
and data was collected from the attacks on this network. The gathered data helped construct the beginning pieces of
what we know today as the ATT&CK® framework.

The ATT&CK® framework has grown and expanded throughout the years. One notable expansion was that the framework
focused solely on the Windows platform but has expanded to cover other platforms, such as macOS and Linux. 
The framework is heavily contributed to by many sources, such as security researchers and threat intelligence reports.
Note this is not only a tool for blue teamers. The tool is also useful for red teamers.

CAR
The official definition of CAR is "The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed 
by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK® adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode 
representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL) in its analytics.
With respect to coverage, CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with 
regards to their operating theory and rationale."

MITRE Engage
Per the website, "MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you 
to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals."
MITRE Engage is considered an Adversary Engagement Approach. This is accomplished by the implementation of Cyber Denial and
Cyber Deception. 
With Cyber Denial we prevent the adversary's ability to conduct their operations and with Cyber Deception we intentionally 
plant artifacts to mislead the adversary. 
The Engage website provides a starter kit to get you 'started' with the Adversary Engagement Approach. The starter kit is 
a collection of whitepapers and PDFs explaining various checklists, methodologies, and processes to get you started. 

D3FEND
What is this MITRE resource? Per the D3FEND website, this resource is "A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures."
D3FEND is still in beta and is funded by the Cybersecurity Directorate of the NSA. 
D3FEND stands for Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense. 
At the time of this writing, there are 408 artifacts in the D3FEND matrix.
